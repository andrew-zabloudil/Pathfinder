# Pathfinder
Python based visual pathfinding algorithm made using PyGame.

The user can use the buttons on the bottom of the screen to place
the start and end nodes, or draw and erase walls to create a unique
pathfinding puzzle for the program to solve.

Clicking the solve button will find and display the shortest path
between the start and end nodes.

If the visualize option is turned on, the program will show the nodes
being tested in real time as it is being run.

NOTE: Turning on the visualize option will result in a decrease of
      speed and performance when solving.
